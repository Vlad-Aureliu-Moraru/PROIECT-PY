## About The Project

This project serves as a visual and educational tool for understanding fundamental concepts in numerical analysis. It provides a graphical representation of how different algorithms attempt to fit a curve through a given set of data points.

Users can interactively add, move, and remove points to see in real-time how the approximation and interpolation curves adapt. The primary goal is to offer a clear, visual comparison between:

  - **Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation** (`Interpolarea Lagrange`)
  - **Cubic Spline Interpolation** (`Interpolarea Spline`)
  - **Bernstein Polynomial Approximation** (`Aproximarea Bernstein`)

This allows for a deeper intuition about the mathematical properties, advantages, and disadvantages of each method.

## Key Features

  - **Interactive Canvas**: Add, move, or delete data points directly on the graph.
  - **Real-time Visualization**: Curves are redrawn instantly as data points change.
  - **Method Comparison**: Display multiple interpolation/approximation curves simultaneously on the same plot.
  - **Algorithm Implementation**: Clean and commented code for each of the core algorithms.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary software installed.

  - Python 3.8 or newer

  - pip (Python package installer)

    ```sh
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

  - A modern web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/[repository-name].git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd [repository-name]
    ```

3.  Install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing your dependencies, e.g., `numpy`, `matplotlib`)*

4.  No installation is needed\! Simply open the main HTML file in your browser.

## Usage

Run the main application script from your terminal:

```sh
python main.py
```

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

-----

Once the application is running:

1.  Click on the canvas to **add new data points**.
2.  **Click and drag** existing points to move them.
3.  Use the control panel or menu to **select/deselect** which interpolation methods you want to display.
4.  Observe how the curves change based on the data points and the chosen algorithm.
