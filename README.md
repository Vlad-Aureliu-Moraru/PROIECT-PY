## About The Project

This project serves as a visual and educational tool for understanding fundamental concepts in numerical analysis. It provides a graphical representation of how different algorithms attempt to fit a curve through a given set of data points.

Users can interactively add, move, and remove points to see in real-time how the approximation and interpolation curves adapt. The primary goal is to offer a clear, visual comparison between:

  - **Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation** (`Interpolarea Lagrange`)
  - **Cubic Spline Interpolation** (`Interpolarea Spline`)
  - **Bernstein Polynomial Approximation** (`Aproximarea Bernstein`)

This allows for a deeper intuition about the mathematical properties, advantages, and disadvantages of each method.

## Key Features

  - **Real-time Visualization**: Curves are redrawn instantly as data points change.
  - **Method Comparison**: Display multiple interpolation/approximation curves simultaneously on the same plot.
  - **Algorithm Implementation**: Clean and commented code for each of the core algorithms.

## Built With

This section lists the major frameworks and libraries used to build the project.

  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)

  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

  - [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)


## Usage

Run the main application script from your terminal:

```sh
python main.py
```

-----

Once the application is running:

1.  Click on the canvas to **add new data points**.
2.  Use the control panel or menu to **select/deselect** which interpolation methods you want to display.
3.  Observe how the curves change based on the data points and the chosen algorithm.
